# [Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)

Part of the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) curriculum.

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.

## Solution

- Built using HTML, CSS, JS, [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
- Inspired by [this Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4139802-Mesosphere-Docs-Product-Design/).
- A simple Scrollspy is written in JavaScript which has been adapted from this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/zchee/pen/ogzvZZ).

## Development tools

- [BrowserSync](https://github.com/Browsersync/browser-sync) is used to provide live reloading during development.
